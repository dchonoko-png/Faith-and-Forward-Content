    <h2>Warfare Prayers Against the Spirit of Poverty</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Money is a tool. In the hands of a righteous believer, it is a powerful weapon for good. The enemy knows this, which is why he works tirelessly to keep believers trapped in a cycle of poverty, debt, and financial struggle. Spiritual warfare in this area involves breaking the spirit of poverty and aligning yourself with God's covenant of provision.</p>

        <li>I cancel every assignment of the enemy to attack my finances through unexpected emergencies, breakdowns, or losses. The blood of Jesus covers my resources.</li>

    <h2>Warfare Prayers Against the Spirit of Infirmity</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. The enemy attacks your body with sickness and infirmity for one primary reason: to disable the warrior. Healing is not something we have to beg God for; it is a provision of the cross that we must learn to receive and enforce by faith.</p>
